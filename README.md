# ⚙️ How It Works

The Express server (server.js) initializes and renders EJS templates for different routes.

index.ejs acts as the homepage, introducing the portfolio and highlighting key projects.

about.ejs details personal and professional information.

contact.ejs provides an interactive contact section.

Static files (CSS, JS, and images) are served from the /Portfolio directory.

Each EJS template is dynamically rendered through Express routes for smooth navigation.
